The #1 Activity Log plugin helps you monitor & log all changes and activities on your WordPress site, so you can run more securely and organized. Works simple & completely free!

== Description ==

<strong>A COMPLETE, EASY TO USE & WELL SUPPORTED WORDPRESS ACTIVITY LOG PLUGIN</strong><br />

Want to monitor and track your WordPress website activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website. the Activity Log plugin is like an airplane's black box that logs every activity in WordPress admin, and lets you see exactly what users are doing on your WordPress website.

* Like, if someone is trying to hack your site.
* Or, when a post was published, and who published it.
* Or, if a plugin/theme was activated/deactivated.
* Log suspicious admin activity.
* Securing your site by tracking log of all user activity?

Useful, right? Trust us, you won't understand how you managed your website without it. The plugin is also lightning fast and works behind the scenes, so it doesn't affect site and admin performance. For optimal performance, we built the plugin so it runs on a separate table in the database.

If you have tens of users or more, you really can’t know who did what. This plugin tries to solve this issue by tracking what users do, and displaying it in an easy to use and easy to filter view on the dashboard of your WordPress site.

<strong>Export to CSV</strong> Export your Activity Log data records to CSV. Developers can easily add support for custom data formats with our new dedicated Export API.

<strong>Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance</strong> We provide the tools to help you be GDPR compliant, including Export/Erasure of data via the WordPress Privacy Tools.
