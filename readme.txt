This top rated Activity Log plugin helps you monitor & log all changes and actions on your WordPress site, so you can remain secure and organized.

== Description ==

<strong>AN EASY TO USE & FULLY SUPPORTED WORDPRESS ACTIVITY LOG PLUGIN</strong><br />

Want to monitor and track your WordPress website activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website with this plugin. Activity Log is like an airplane’s black box that logs every action in the WordPress admin, and lets you see exactly what users are doing on your WordPress website.

* If someone is trying to hack your site
* When a post was published, and who published it
* If a plugin/theme was activated/deactivated
* Suspicious admin activity

It’s so essential; you’ll wonder how you ever managed your website without it. The plugin is also lightning fast and works behind the scenes, so it doesn\’t affect site and admin performance. For optimal performance, we built the plugin so that it runs on a separate table in the database.

If you have more than a handful of users, keeping track of who did what is virtually impossible. This plugin solves that issue by tracking what actions were initiated by which users, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and easy-to-filter view on the dashboard of your WordPress site.

<strong>New! Introducing Email Logging</strong> - Capture all emails sent from your WordPress site for streamlined debugging and compliance. Gain better visibility into email communication, aiding both troubleshooting and record-keeping. This is particularly beneficial for WooCommerce stores, allowing you to easily track sent emails alongside other critical site events.

<strong>Export to CSV</strong> - Export your Activity Log data records to CSV. Developers can easily add support for custom data formats with our new dedicated Export API.

<strong>Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance</strong> - We provide the tools to help you adhere to GDPR compliance standards, including Export/Erasure of data via the WordPress Privacy Tools.

<h3>With the Activity Log you can record:</h3>

* <strong>WordPress</strong> - Core updates
* <strong>Posts</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Pages</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Custom Post Type</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Tags</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Categories</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Taxonomies</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Menus</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Media</strong> - Created, updated, deleted
* <strong>Comments</strong> - Created, approved, unapproved, trashed, untrashed, spammed, unspammed, deleted
* <strong>Users</strong> - Login, logout, login failed, update profile, registered, deleted
* <strong>Plugins</strong> - Installed, updated, activated, deactivated, changed
* <strong>Themes</strong> - Installed, updated, deleted, activated, changed (Editor and Customizer)
* <strong>Widgets</strong> - Added to sidebar, deleted from sidebar, order widgets
* <strong>Setting</strong> - General, writing, reading, discussion, media, permalinks
* <strong>Options</strong> - Extended custom settings for 3rd party plugins
* <strong>Export</strong> - Exported activity log file
* <strong>WooCommerce</strong> - Track products, orders, customers, and more
* <strong>bbPress</strong> - Forums, topics, replies, taxonomies, and other actions
* <strong>Emails sent from WordPress site</strong> - Sending successful, sending failed
* There’s more, of course, but you get the point...

For each event recorded by the activity log, the following details are also logged:

* Date and time of occurrence
* User and user role responsible for the change
* Source IP address from which the change originated
* Affected object where the change occurred

The plugin doesn\’t require any kind of setup; it works right out of the box (just another reason people love it)!

<h3>Data Storage and Performance Optimization</h3>

In order to ensure optimal performance of your website, all events and logs data are stored in a dedicated custom table within your WordPress database. This approach significantly reduces the impact on your website's performance, ensuring seamless operation even during peak traffic periods.

<h3>Uninstall Clean-up</h3>

We understand the importance of maintaining a clean and efficient database environment. That's why our plugin features an uninstall hook that seamlessly removes all traces of its presence from your website when uninstalling. This meticulous clean-up process ensures that your database remains lean and clutter-free even after our plugin has been removed.

<strong>With our optimized data storage, thorough logging, and meticulous clean-up process, you can trust that our plugin will enhance the functionality and security of your WordPress site without compromising its performance.</strong>
